# *apollo-tracing-js* with *graphql-result-size* extension

This repo contains a version of [apollo-tracing-js](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tracing-js) (v0.1.4) extended with support for timing of a prototypical result size calculation step (as implemented in [github:LiUGraphQL/graphql-result-size](https://github.com/LiUGraphQL/graphql-result-size)).

We have used this extension in a [GraphQL server created for experiments](https://github.com/LiUGraphQL/experiment-tim).
